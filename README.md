# Code for the Recreational Exposure to Polluted Seawater (REPS) systematic review and meta-analysis (SRMA) protocol

R code used in 'The association between recreational exposure to polluted  seawater and estimated cases of infection  by faecal microorganisms: A protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis'. The repository contains a single R script ('quantsynth_demo.R') which demonstrates the core quantitative synthesis (meta-analytical modelling and visualisation) methods which are intended to be used in the final review. The script takes as its input the meta-analytical dataset from members of this review team's similar previous systematic review (Leonard et al. 2018a, 2018b), which contains estimates of the association/effect based on estimated cases of infection in non-bathers versus bathers. However, the meta-analytical dataset assembled for our new systematic review will contain estimates of the association/effect based on estimated cases of infection in those least exposed to pollution versus those more exposed to pollution.

1. Open the 'REPS-SRMA_protocol.RProj' R Project file (which will open R)
2. Open 'quantsynth_demo.R' in the 'src' folder (which will then open the script within the R Project)
3. Run the code to populate the 'figures' folder with the figures
