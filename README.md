# leonardetal2018SRMAupdate_protocol
Code used in the development of the protocol of the update of Leonard et al. (2018)'s systematic review of the association between recreational exposure to seawater and putative infection by sewage-borne microorganisms. To run:

1. Open the 'leonardetal2018SRMAupdate_protocol.RProj' file (which will open R)
2. Open 'SRMAupdate_code' in the 'src' folder (which will then open the script within the R Project)
3. Run the code to populate the 'figures' folder with the figures
